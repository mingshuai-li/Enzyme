# Enzyme
This repository contains a set of examples about how to use Enzyme in different languages and some benchmarks.

## Overview
Enzyme is a tool that takes arbitrary existing code as LLVM IR and computes the derivative (and gradient) of that function.
All of the examples based on the Enzyme, which is a plugin for LLVM. If you want to look into the code, you can click [Enzyme](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme) or 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme
$ cd Enzyme
```
If you have Homebrew, you can also use
```shell
$ brew install enzyme
```
